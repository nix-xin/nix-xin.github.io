    "snippet": "Blogging ConsistentlyI started the year hoping to blog more. I must have tried out at least 7 or 8 different blogging platforms over the years. Recently settled on Medium, but haven’t made significant progress. I think I’m always searching for the perfect feeling of visual representation of my words. I often stare at the screen, simply looking at the font, expecting it to tell me that its okay. But it never does.I suppose I must continue Blogging, at least a little more consistently."
